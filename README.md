# ABCdynamicsofsalesXYZ
Pet project: Three tasks in the sphere of trade: ABC-analysis, Dynamics of sales, XYZ-analysis.  
# Data:   
We have a piece of information provided by a pharmacy chain in which there is data about sales.
Used columns: 
  + DR_NDrugs - product name
  + DR_Kol - number of pieces sold
  + DR_CRoz - 
# Task:   
We need to perform three types of analysis: 
  1. ABC-analysis
  2. Sales dynamics
  3. XYZ-analysis
# Solution:
First I imported pandas and Numpy libraries, then configured the working area using function Set_Option.
# 1. ABC-analysis:  
One-dimensional ABC-analysis:  
  + Loaded the dataframe
  + Counted sales by product
  + Counted the contribution of each product
  + Counted the sales as an accumulation
  +
